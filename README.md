# IA Frontend Project about calories of people should eat per day

**Fully Coded Elements**
The use of artificial intelligence to help users keep proper control over each other's daily diet, especially when they must adhere to a medicated diet, can bring notable benefits to their health. Therefore, we seek to create an application that implements AI and serves to meet this goal.

**Objective**
Develop a program that through AI can identify and inform its users about the consumption of calories that are in their eating habits, this in order for the user to become aware of what they consume and can have a healthier diet and can improve their Health.
